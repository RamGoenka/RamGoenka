## I am interested in:

       - ``Full stack web-development`` as I enjoy working with website code and developing user friendly interfaces

       - ``Data Science and Analytics`` since data is all around us and can help one to learn a lot about a plethora of interesting facts using data. I                also am interesting in utilizing programming languages (mainly Python) to create data visualizations!
       
       - ``Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence`` 


## I am currently:
