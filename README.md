- I am interested in web development, preferably front-end, however I can work on back-end if needed. I am also interested in Data Science and analytics, machine learning (ML), and learning more about the theoretical concepts and aspects of Computer Science.

- I am currently: 
    - Working as a web-developer at [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) 
    - Course Associate for [CS 124 @ UIUC](https://www.cs124.org/)
    - Course Assistant for [STAT/CS/IS 107 @ UIUC](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/)
