- 📝 I am an undergraduate student @ University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am majoring in Mathematics :1234: and minoring in Computer Science :computer: and Statistics :bar_chart: 

- 👀 I am interested in web development, preferably front-end, however I can work on back-end if needed :thumbsup:. I am also interested in Data Science :bar_chart:, machine learning, and exploring and learning more about algorithms and the intersections between Computer Science, Statistics and Mathematics :thought_balloon:

- 💻 I also find programming languages very interesting and I am interested in learning more about them!
