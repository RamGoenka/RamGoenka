## I am interested in:

- Full stack web-development, as I enjoy working with website code and developing user friendly interfaces (I like working with front-end more but back-end is something I have experience with too :))
       
- Data Science and Analytics since data is all around us and can help one to learn a lot about a plethora of interesting facts using data. I                also am interesting in utilizing programming languages (mainly Python) to create data visualizations!
       
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are two fields that I have not yet gotten the chance to dive deep into but will be taking courses in soon to hopefully deepen my knowledge of these fields!

- Theoratical Computer Science, which I gained interest in after taking the course in Data Structures and Algorithms, where I particularly enjoyed the theory based content on graph traversals and how the various data structures work :)


## I am currently: 

   - Working as a web-developer at [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) 
    
   - Course Associate for [CS 124 @ UIUC](https://www.cs124.org/)
    
   - Course Assistant for [STAT/CS/IS 107 @ UIUC](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/)

Hope you have a great day! :)
