## :wave: Hello!

My name is Ram Goenka and I am currently an undergraduate student @ UIUC majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science and Statistics. Some of the topics that I am interested in are exploring more about are the mathematical aspects of machine learning, web-development (full stack), data science + analytics and statistics. In my free time, I enjoy working with web-development tools, mainly working on front-end components! I also enjoy exploring computational mathematical concepts and hope to dive deeper into what lies within computational math. Another interest of mine is to work with data visualization tools to develop plots of data to better understand the topic being disucssed in the data.  

## 📝 I am currently: 

   - Working as a software-developer at [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) 
    
   - Course Associate for [CS 124 @ UIUC](https://www.cs124.org/)
    
   - Course Assistant for [STAT/CS/IS 107 @ UIUC](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/)

Hope you have a great day! :)
