## :wave: Hello!

My name is Ram Goenka and I am currently an undergraduate student @ UIUC majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science and Statistics. Some of the things that I am interested in are learning more about the mathematical aspects of machine learning, web-development (full stack), data analytics and statistics. In my free time, I enjoy working with web-development tools, mainly working on front-end components! I also enjoy exploring computational mathematical concepts and hope to dive deeper into what lies within computational math! 

## üìù I am currently: 

   - Working as a software-developer at [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) 
    
   - Course Associate for [CS 124 @ UIUC](https://www.cs124.org/)
    
   - Course Assistant for [STAT/CS/IS 107 @ UIUC](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/)

Hope you have a great day! :)
